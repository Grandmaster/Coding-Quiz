# Coding-Quiz

The code in this repo designs a site that quizzes users on their basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows users to take the quiz completely online, and gives them a chance to record their score at the end of the quiz. The site can be found here: [Coding Quiz](https://grandmaster.github.io/Coding-Quiz).

## Installation
The site can be run on any modern browser.

## Usage

Upon arriving at the site, the user can read some info on the quiz process, and click on the button at the center of the page to start the quiz. Once the quiz has started, each question will be displayed on the window, and the options to answer the question show up as buttons under the question. If the user gets a question correct, they move on to the next question. If not, the user takes a time penalty and continues the quiz. The score at the end of the quiz is actually equal to the time left, so the quicker the quiz is completed, the higher the score.

## Demonstration

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
